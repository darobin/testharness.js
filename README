== Introduction ==

testharness.js provides a framework for writing javascript-based test
cases, mainly aimed at browser developers and other implementors.

It is intended to provide a convenient API for making common
assertions, and to work both for testing synchronous and asynchronous
DOM features in a way that promotes clear, robust, tests.

For details on usage, see the inline documentation in src/testharness.js
